# Sources on HNLP
*Last updated October 7, 2022*

In the Human Name Listing Project (HNLP), **sources** are used to verify the statements
in a name definition.

## Reliable sources
In HNLP, all sources on name definitions must be **reliable sources**, that is, they must
be published, secondary, independent of HNLP and reputable. Also, all name definitions in HNLP
must cite reliable sources, and all statements in name definitions must be verifiable using
the cited reliable soruces.

## Criteria for reliable sources
This is the criteria for a source to be considered a reliable source in HNLP.
1. **Published** - the source must be publicly available.
2. **Secondary** - they must be a secondary source, i.e. created using an original source, by an
   author different than the original source's author.
3. **Independent** - they must not use any HNLP databases as a source, and must be independent
   from HNLP.
4. **Reputable** - they have a reputation for fact-checking and accurateness.
